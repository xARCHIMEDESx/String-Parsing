Despite the eye lenses of his helmet shading him from the worst effects, 
Khârn still found himself squinting against the brilliant reflections from 
Haeleon’s glass-smooth surface. Of all the unforgiving balls of rock on 
which he had fought for the glory of the Blood God, this had to be one of 
the most forbidding. Its three suns ensured nothing could survive long on 
the lifeless shell without protection, and he could feel the searing heat 
on his exposed left arm as he hefted Gorechild in readiness for the approaching 
battle. Khârn had very little regard for most оf the loyalist forces, or 
for any other, but during the days of Horus he had seen the White Scars’ 
prowess as hunters and masters оf the lightning attack. The vast expanses 
of perfectly flat, baked ground would lend themselves well to the Chogorians’ 
way of fast, mobile warfare. They must have thought it a gift from their 
Emperor when Khârn had made planetfall here and their ship had miraculously 
managed to 'evade' Shipmaster Roderbar’s scanners to allow their attack.
